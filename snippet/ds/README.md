This TypeScript code is creating a `Map` object from an array of objects. The keys of the `Map` are the `id` properties of the objects, and the values are the objects themselves.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. `rows.map((object) => object.object_id)`: This line is creating an array of `object_id` values from the `rows` array.

2. `await myService.exampleMethod(...)`: This line is calling the `exampleMethod` of `myService` with the array of `object_id` values. The `exampleMethod` is an asynchronous function that returns a `Promise`, so `await` is used to wait for the promise to resolve. The `exampleMethod` returns an array of objects, where each object has an `id` property and an `object_id` property.

3. `).map((object) => { return [object.id, object]; })`: This line is mapping over the array of objects and transforming each object into a two-element array where the first element is the object's `id` and the second element is the object itself. This is done because the `Map` constructor takes an iterable of key-value pairs, and each key-value pair is represented as a two-element array.

4. `const result = new Map<string, object>(...)`: This line is creating a new `Map` from the array of key-value pairs. The `Map` will have string keys (the object IDs) and object values.

The commented-out `myFunc` function at the end of the code does the same thing, but encapsulates the logic in a function that can be called later.

The code is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) with an `async` keyword. This allows the use of `await` at the top level of the code, since `await` can only be used inside an `async` function. The IIFE is immediately called, so the code runs as soon as it's defined.
